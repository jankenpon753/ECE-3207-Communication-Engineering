\section*{Theory}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Theory}
Analog signal transmission and reception are fundamental concepts in communication engineering. Analog signals are continuous signals that vary over time and can take any value within a given range. These signals are used to transmit information such as audio, video, and other data over various mediums like air, cables, and optical fibers \cite{haykin2001communication}. In this experiment, we focus on Amplitude Modulation (AM) and demodulation.
\\\\
\textbf{Amplitude Modulation (AM)}: In AM, the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the information signal. This technique is widely used in radio broadcasting \cite{sklar2001digital}.
\\\\
The reception of analog signals involves demodulation, which is the process of extracting the original information signal from the modulated carrier wave. This is achieved using various demodulation techniques corresponding to the modulation methods used during transmission \cite{sklar2001digital}.

Analog signal transmission and reception are susceptible to noise and interference, which can degrade the quality of the received signal. Techniques such as filtering and amplification are employed to mitigate these effects and improve signal quality \cite{haykin2001communication}.
\\\\
Overall, understanding analog signal transmission and reception is crucial for designing and analyzing communication systems that rely on analog signals \cite{proakis2007digital}.

\section*{Discussion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Discussion}
The experiment and Matlab simulation demonstrate the process of analog signal transmission and reception using Amplitude Modulation (AM). The original message signal is modulated by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal, resulting in the modulated signal. The modulated signal is then demodulated to retrieve the original message signal.
\\\\
The waveforms of the original message signal, the modulated signal, and the demodulated signal are observed and compared. The demodulated signal closely resembles the original message signal, demonstrating the effectiveness of the demodulation process.
